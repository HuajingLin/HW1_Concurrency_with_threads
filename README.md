# Concurrency_with_threads
program to count the frequency of words in a plaintext file. Python

You may implement your assignment in Java, C++, or Python. Your program should be named word-frequency-count.<java, cpp, py>. The program should accept two parameters as command line arguments. The first parameter, in_filename, should be the full path name of a text file that will be used as input to your program. The second parameter, N, should be the number of text file segments that will be examined in parallel. Your program should write the number of threads (N), the input file name (in_filename), and the elapsed execution time of the program, and a list of words with their frequency of occurrence in the input text to a file named hw1_out.txt in the local directory.
